# Readmate Application

The aim of the project is to create an online event management system where users can create, view and apply for events. 

## Features:

    - Users register to the system by entering their name, surname, e-mail address and password.
    - Users who log in to the system with their e-mail address and password can view the information they provided during registration on their profile page and change their password.
    - Information for an admin user is defined when the system is standing up.
    - The admin user who logs into the system edits the categories and the city information required for the location, which is required when creating an event.
    - Admin user reviews and approves activities created by users or rejects it.
    - Users define an event by entering its name, date, description (for promotional text, details, etc.), city, address, quota and category. They choose the category and city from the options defined in the system.
    - The user can cancel the event he/she has created up to 5 days before the date of the event. Likewise, until 5 days before the event, the quota and address information can update it.
    - Users can view the events defined in the system and participate in the ones they want. They need to buy a ticket for this process. Tickets are free of charge. Each ticket has a ticket number indicating that it is event and personalized.
    - When users enter the event area, their ticket numbers are checked by the staff at the door.
    - Users display the events they have organized and the events they have participated in on their own pages.
